### 문제 설명

<p><img alt="" src="" style="float:right; height:130px; width:240px">Morse code was an early method of communication via electronic signals. Each letter and number was represented by a unique series of long and short tones, with a pause to indicate the beginning of the next character. Implement a Morse Code interpreter, using the key to the right, that translates five-letter messages (no more, no less).</p>

### 입력 

 <p>The first line of input is the number of test cases that follow.</p>

<p>Each input case appears on a single line, and will include five Morse code characters, a space-separated series of long and short tones, represented by dots and dashes.</p>

<p>There will be at most 1000 test cases.</p>

### 출력 

 <p>For each case, output the line “Case x:” where x is the case number, on a single line. Then output a single space followed by an all-caps alphanumeric representation of the message, exactly five characters in length.</p>
