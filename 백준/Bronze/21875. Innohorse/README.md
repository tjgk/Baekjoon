### 문제 설명

<p>In Innokingdom there are special horses for chess knights, innohorses. Each innohorse is represented by a pair of integers $(x, y)$, $0 \le x \le y$. Innohorse moves in the following way: first it moves $x$ cells in one of the four general directions, then turns 90 degrees to the left or to the right, then finally moves $y$ more cells. For instance, an ordinary chess knight horse is an innohorse of type $(1, 2)$.</p>

<p>Alex and Jane has just seen one innohorse, it jumped from cell A to cell B. They wonder what is the type of this innohorse. Help them answer this question.</p>

### 입력

### 출력
