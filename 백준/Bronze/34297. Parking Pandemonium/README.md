### 문제 설명

<p>As part of Colorado School of Mines' 150th anniversary this year, the university is engaged in many infrastructure projects including constructing new buildings and renovating existing ones. These projects include a new innovation center with makerspaces focused on cross-discipline collaboration, increased classroom capacity, additional student housing to allow Mines to accommodate all freshmen and sophomore students, and parking garages to accommodate the rising number of students and faculty.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, the construction of these new buildings has temporarily reduced the amount of available parking in some areas of campus. However, a bright Mines student named Hannah realized that she can find a parking spot if she circles around the parking lot long enough waiting for another student to finish classes and head home. Hannah has determined that it takes exactly $M$ minutes to circle the parking lot once.</p>

<p>Given that Hannah circles the parking lot exactly $C$ times before finally finding a parking spot, how long will it take for her to find a parking spot?</p>

### 입력 

 <p>The first line of input contains a single integer $1 \leq M \leq 10^4$, the time (in minutes) it takes for Hannah to circle the parking lot once.</p>

<p>The second line of input contains a single integer $250 \leq K \leq 320$, the temperature (in Kelvin) of the parking lot.</p>

<p>The third line of input contains a single integer $1 \leq C \leq 10^4$, the number of times Hannah has to circle the parking lot before finding a parking spot.</p>

### 출력 

 <p>The first and only line of output should contain a single integer, the total amount of time (in minutes) it takes for Hannah to find a parking spot.</p>
