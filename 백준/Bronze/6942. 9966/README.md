### 문제 설명

<p>The digits $0$, $1$, and $8$ look much the same if rotated $180$ degrees on the page (turned upside down). Also, the digit $6$ looks much like a $9$, and vice versa, when rotated $180$ degrees on the page. A multi-digit number may also look like itself when rotated on the page; for example $9966$ and $10\,801$ do, but $999$ and $1234$ do not.</p>

<p>You are to write a program to count how many numbers from a given interval look like themselves when rotated $180$ degrees on the page. For example, in the interval $[1 \dots 100]$ there are six: $1$, $8$, $11$, $69$, $88$, and $96$.</p>

<p>Your program should take as input two integers, $m$ and $n$, which define the interval to be checked, $1 \le m \le n \le 32\,000$. The output from your program is the number of rotatable numbers in the interval.</p>

<p>You may assume that all input is valid.</p>
