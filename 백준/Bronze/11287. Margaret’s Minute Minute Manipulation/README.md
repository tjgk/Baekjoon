### 문제 설명

<p>Margaret has always been a good maths student. She has been trying to apply the principles of binary quantum refraction to time travel in her free time. By encoding time in a binary format and adding a non negative time difference, δ, she is hoping to create a singularity in the fabric of space and time allowing one to jump by the amount δ into the future.</p>

<p>Time’s usual representation is the well known 24h format - e.g. 03:14:15. Although there is several possible ways to represent time in a binary form, the convention used throughout this exercise is as follows.</p>

<p style="text-align:center"><img alt="" src="" style="height:115px; width:337px"></p>

<p style="text-align:center">Figure 1: Binary Clock Format of time 03:14:15.</p>

<p>A 4 × 6 matrix can be used to represent time in a binary format. Each decimal digit of the 24h format is encoded separately using 4 bits. The decimal digits are encoded in binary with the most significant bit on top, and the least significant at the bottom. For instance, the decimal number 3<sub>10</sub> can be represented as 0011<sub>2</sub> in a 4-digit binary format, i.e. (0 × 2<sup>3</sup>) + (0 × 2<sup>2</sup>) + (1 × 2<sup>1</sup>) + (1 × 2<sup>0</sup>) = 3.</p>

<p>Provided a time of day T and a time difference δ, both in the Binary Clock format, you are to compute the time of day resulting from their summation, i.e. T + δ.</p>

### 입력 

 <p>The first 4 lines represent the time of day and the subsequent 4 lines represent the time delta. Both clocks are guaranteed to be a valid time ranging from 00:00:00 to 23:59:59 inclusively. We further assume a naive implementation of time in which we do not care about time zones, leap seconds, nor the shifting effects of daylight saving time.</p>

### 출력 

 <p>The output should consist of the resulting time (T +δ) in the 4×6 matrix Binary Clock format. This should immediately be followed by a newline.</p>
